# Introduction
   In the Arduino based Ultrasonic project, we blend the concept of ultrasonic sensor that is usually used to detect any mass within the range with an Arduino uno board. Along with that we also introduce some more modifications such as sirens and lights to make it realistic. Basically we are trying to make it like a safe zone. This area will be under proper security measures and we will handle these measures with our codes. And in this we also tried to merge some lab exercises and make it more efficient.
	   This idea of ultrasonic sensors is mainly considered in Sonars, water vehicles and many other space shuttles. The basic principle of Ultrasonic sensors is to detect the presence of any kind of mass and show it on the radar system. This is a kind of security protocol that each and every Airport uses in the Control room to manage the air traffic. This device is so useful in today's world to resist criminal activities. 
	 
# Modification
  This project will behave similar to the military base in grand theft auto 5. In that case, when you initially enter that restricted area then they give us a warning to step back but no one cares about that warning because everyone is playing for fun. After that they start firing from their equipment to eliminate the player and this process keeps going on until the player loses the cops. We are trying to implement that idea in our project. That was interesting because the things we are playing online on our playstations are becoming real. And we are very thankful that we get this opportunity of making these things in real.
